How The Money Moves

I built this website as a project for the Intermediate Interactive Multimedia class at the University of North Carolina. The project had two goals:
1) Produce a work of data journalism with at least three visualizations
2) Emulate the style of a major news publication

To accomplish the first goal, I combed through U.S. census data and found some interesting trends in the migration patterns of Americans at different income levels. I visualized the data with the HighCharts JavaScript library and cartoDB mapping tools (this was my first foray into data vis; I hadn't discovered D3 yet).

For the second objective, I chose to emulate the style of FiveThirtyEight. I tried to make it look as much like a real FiveThirtyEight article as possible. The resemblance is purely for educational purposes and indicated as such in the footer.
